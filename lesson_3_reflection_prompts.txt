When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you have not internet conection, it's very comfortable.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you can regulate your commit's and changes. Git don't now in which moment pull data's.
