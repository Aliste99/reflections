How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It's help us to find mistake in our proggram.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It's make easy work with programm. You can watch old wersion and find mistake in new version.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

You can write your own comments with explanation. If you don't do this, you don't understand what's going on.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It's not bad and not good. I don't think anysink about this.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 
 To start, we need to write git log in in line and find our first and second file.
 Our second step: we need to compare two our files and find edded and delated lines.
 
 
 
 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It's more easy to write programm.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
